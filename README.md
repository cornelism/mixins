# SASS Mixins

useful mixins I've come across  

clone this in your sass directory:
```
git clone https://github.com/cornelism/mixins.git
```

then just @import 'PATH/TO/mixins/mixins' into you stylesheet


## TO DO

1. improve UI: tooltips, buttons, animation, ...
2. convert to scss and less (or use gulp converter ?)
